									Our mission is to empower fish farmers in Ghana with the
									needed technology to accelerate their production to meet the
									national fish requirement and also bridge the countryâ€™s fish
									deficit. Ghana imports about $280M worth of fish annually as
									the fish deficit gap stands at 68%. Marine catches have over
									the last two decades reduced drastically even though the
									government has over the years implemented key strategies such
									as the close season to revamp the marine stock. Local
									producers or farmers who are predominantly engaged in the
									culture of tilapia and catfish are unable to produce to a
									scale that meets the local demand. They lack necessary
									production tools and technologies and access to key input
									subsidies to boost and make their production sustainable. The
									aquaculture sector in Ghana is believed to have the highest
									rate of attrition due to these aforementioned challenges.
									Aquamet is developing technologies that are geared towards
									increasing average fish yield by 50%, increasing smallholder
									farmers revenue and improving the food security in the
									country.
